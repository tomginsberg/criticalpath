For several years, Critical Path Projects has partnered with Canadian Tire to build new stores and renovate and expand existing locations across Canada. We work seamlessly with Canadian Tire’s internal project teams, providing support when there are too many projects or when specialized expertise is required. With a deep understanding of the complexities involved in ground-up construction, as well as the challenges of working in active retail spaces, we effectively manage consultant teams, landlords, and other project stakeholders. Our team also oversees budgets and schedules, ensuring that each store’s manager and dealer are kept informed and satisfied throughout every phase of the project.   Here are some of the stores we have helped build, expand or renovate:​
