This two year project focused on repairing the entire building envelope of this 108 year old lovely building.Â  Significant parts of the stonework on the building had begun to deteriorate due to weather and water infiltration. Skilled stonemasons were retained to cut new stone for deteriorated sections, the old windows were removed, stripped and replaced and all masonry was cleaned. It is ready for another 100 years!
