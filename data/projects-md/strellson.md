The owner of high end menâ€™s wear label Strellson required expertise to help with their expansion into the Rideau Centre in Ottawa and Yorkdale mall in Toronto.  Critical Path Projects was engaged to structure the projects, recommend and engage architects, engineers and designers as well as contractors. The firm oversaw the entire design process as well as tendering and managing the construction and IT. Both projects were delivered on time and on budget.
