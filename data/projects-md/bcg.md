Critical Path Projects worked as the Project Manager with all teams to successfully deliver a state-of-the-art office fit-out across floors 45–48 in one of Toronto’s premier downtown towers. Over a 24-month schedule, we managed every detail of this 105,000+ sq. ft. project to create a modern workspace that meets the highest global standards.

### A Dynamic Workspace Designed for Excellence

Our fit-out included:

- Executive Reception & Boardrooms: Elegant, high-performance areas that set the tone for the corporate environment.
- Flexible Meeting & Town Hall Spaces: Operable partitions and tech-enabled solutions that support collaborative work and dynamic events.
- Diverse Work Zones: Open workstations, enclosed offices, and integrated room booking systems designed to support a hoteling-based work model.

A key feature of the project is the three-storey interconnecting staircase anchored by a striking in-floor atrium. This design centerpiece required the installation of large, motorized rolling fire shutters—an engineering challenge that was met through precise coordination with the base building team during tower construction. We ensured seamless integration of critical infrastructure, life safety systems, and the building envelope with the interior fit-out.

### Partnering for Success

In collaboration with Prime Consultant HOK, the Construction Manager and the Client our expert project management team ensured every phase was executed to perfection, delivering a high-performance, aesthetically compelling workspace that exemplifies modern corporate design.
