This manufacturer of commercial water filtration systems moved from 5 separate locations to one brand new building that has offices and the production floor co located.  Critical Path Projects orchestrated the deisign, construction of the interior spaces and the move to ensure business operations were disrupted as little as possible.  The result is fantastic new work space for Anderson.
